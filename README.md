# College Grievance Tracker üèõÔ∏è

A web application designed to streamline grievance submission and management within a college environment, providing a platform for students to voice concerns and for administrators to track and resolve issues efficiently.

## Project Overview

This project aims to bridge the communication gap between students and college administration regarding grievances. It offers a user-friendly interface for students to submit various types of grievances (e.g., academic, facilities, conduct) and a comprehensive dashboard for administrators to review, manage, and update the status of these issues. The system prioritizes ease of use, real-time tracking, and secure access for different user roles.

    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd College-Grievance-Tracker
    ```

### Database Configuration

The application uses a MySQL database. Update the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file with your MySQL database credentials.

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/Your_DB?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=Your_Password
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect

```

## User Roles and Dashboards

The system supports two primary roles: **STUDENT** and **ADMIN**.

### Student Role

* **Registration**: New users register as students through the `/register` page.
* **Login**: Students log in via the `/login` page, selecting the "Student" role.
* **Student Dashboard (`/student-dashboard`)**: After successful login, students are redirected to their personalized dashboard. From here, they can:
    * Submit new grievances.
    * View all their submitted grievances with their current status.
    * Search for specific grievances.

---

### Admin Role

* **Initial Admin Setup**: An admin user with email `admin@admin.com` and password `admin` is automatically created if not present on application startup by `AdminSetupService`.
* **Login**: Administrators log in via the `/login` page, selecting the "Admin" role.
* **Admin Dashboard (`/admin-dashboard`)**: After successful login, administrators are redirected to their dashboard. From here, they can:
    * View a comprehensive list of all grievances submitted by all students, sorted by creation date (descending).
    * Update the status of any grievance to "Pending" or "Resolved".
    * View a list of all registered users, sorted by creation date (descending).
